# BashCalc: Arbitrary Precision CLI Calculator

## Description
A command-line calculator implemented in C with support for arbitrary precision arithmetic â€” inspired by the Unix `bc` tool. Built from scratch without relying on any external libraries, this tool handles large integers and precise calculations via string-based logic.

## Features
- Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles numbers of any size with precision beyond built-in data types
- CLI-based input with intuitive syntax
- Custom-built logic for mathematical operations using string manipulation

## Technologies Used
- C
- Custom string parsing and memory handling
- Terminal I/O
